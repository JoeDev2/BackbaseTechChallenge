Get all CSV data to get ALL MOVIES from the CSV.
Multi-user support with aggregated rating system.
Authorization and Authentication for each API user.
Add further validation.
Add more unit tests (only tested the main service due to time constraints)
Implement integration tests using containerised Docker test for simulated environment
Add logging.
Add caching and rate limiting to the API. The caching will make it mroe scalable when repeated
api calls are made and rate limiting will prevent abuse of the api and prevent DDOS attacks.
Add database indexes on frequently queried fields to improve performance.
